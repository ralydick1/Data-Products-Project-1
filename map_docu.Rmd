## Interactive Map Assignment: Developing Data Products
This is a simple project from the Develpoing Data Projects course on Coursera taught by Johns Hopkin's University. The requirements of the assignment are to:

* Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
* Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
* Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

Below is the code that will run on the webpage.

```{r map}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=33.8911,lng=-84.4684, popup="Truist Park")
my_map
```
